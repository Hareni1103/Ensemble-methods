## Introduction

The project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting credit card approval decisions. This is an important task in the banking and finance sector to automate the approval process and minimize the risk of default.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset consists of applicant information such as income, education, employment status, and other relevant features. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identify patterns in the data. Visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices are used for data exploration.

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on the dataset to predict credit card approval decisions. These include:

- XGBoost
- AdaBoost
- CatBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation

The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The accuracy scores for each algorithm are compared to determine the best-performing model.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting credit card approval decisions. The best-performing model can be deployed in real-world applications to automate and streamline the credit approval process, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of default.
